necromine is a 3D isometric game, where you play a coal-miner who's been witnessed a planned TNT detonation gone wrong and turned into coal-mining disaster. The massive explosion caused wide-area collapses, which opened underground passage spawning hellish creatures, scattering violently.

The game is mainly turn-based, where you lead the character to escape the horror while fighting creatures and gathering survivors to join you. This project is written in Java using the libGdx framework. You're welcome to explore the source code.
